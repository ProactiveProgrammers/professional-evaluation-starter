## Assigned: Friday, April 22, 2022
## Due: Friday, April 29, 2022

After cloning this repository to your computer, please take the following steps:

- Follow the instructions inside of the `evaluation.md` file in the `writing`
  directory, making sure that you complete all aspects of this project.
- At a high level, you need to assess yourself on a Likert scale with 1
  indicating the lowest level of competence and 5 indicating the greatest level
  of competence and the other values showing varying levels in between.
- For each ranking that you submit, you should also provide a justification for
  your response that makes it clear why you have attained mastery of the
  learning objective at the specified level.
- Make sure that you accurately rank your level of competence since you will not
  receive a higher grade for this project if you artificially inflate or deflate
  your skills in the various learning outcomes for this course
- Do not forget to provide a ranking for each of the detailed learning outcomes
  for the course! For every one of the lowest-level bullet points you should
  either provide a ranking for yourself between 1 and 5 or the score of "N/A"
  if you think that we have not yet covered that content in the course.
- If you are not sure whether we have covered a specific topic in the course,
  please refer to the course schedule that is available at:
  https://proactiveprogrammers.com/discrete-structures/schedule-discrete-structures/
- Please only mark a specific learning object as "N/A" if you genuinely believe
  that we have not yet covered that topic in the course. If you are in doubt
  about the coverage of a specific topic, please clarify your questions with the
  course instructor.
